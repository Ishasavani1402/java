Min and Max in Array
Difficulty: BasicAccuracy: 68.55%Submissions: 289K+Points: 1
Given an array arr. Your task is to find the minimum and maximum elements in the array.

Note: Return an array that contains two elements the first one will be a minimum element and the second will be a maximum of an array.

Examples:

Input: arr = [3, 2, 1, 56, 10000, 167]
Output: 1 10000
Explanation: minimum and maximum elements of array are 1 and 10000.
Input: arr = [1, 345, 234, 21, 56789]
Output: 1 56789
Explanation: minimum and maximum element of array are 1 and 56789.
Input: arr = [56789]
Output: 56789 56789
Explanation: Since the array contains only one element so both min & max are same.
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= arr.size() <= 105
1 <= arr[i] <=1012

class Solution {
    public Pair<Long, Long> getMinMax(int[] arr) {
         int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for(int i=0; i<arr.length; i++){
              max = Math.max(max, arr[i]);
              min = Math.min(min, arr[i]);
        }
        return new Pair(min, max);

    }
}
